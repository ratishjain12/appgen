# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use ".env.example" to build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to `schema.prisma`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env` and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.mjs" should be updated accordingly.
